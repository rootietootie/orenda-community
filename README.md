Introduction
------------

This is an open source version of the fimware, Android App and iOS App software for the Orenda coffee maker, produced by the Auroma Brewing Company (ABC)

Have fun. Have coffee.  ###this is NOT the readme. rather, merge with TODO

Why, haven't ABC produced their own?
------------------------------------

Their firmware appears buggy, as does the iOS App and crashes on tablets. The Android App remains AWOL.  This project is completely independent of them, and doesn't not make any use of their code.  ABC's customer service leaves much to be desired.

The intent is to be open about we're doing.  The result may not be for everyone, and the way the apps work will likely be very different to the ABC version, but we think this is going to be powerful, useful and fun.

Look at the TODO list

Get in touch with me.  Nico Paul @ support@guardog.net (Pnaulls is more attentive than previously suspected, although still most likely over this project and cpmpany like most of us) (written sept 20th 2018, this git is up to date and will continue to recieve weekly updates.)

this week i have officially recieved the release order which releases the P1 MODULE WITH OUR CONNECTION INFO! now with that being allowed to officially be claimed we can start withour replacement photon board. (need input screen ideas)

Chose Neopixel Jewel 7 rgbw for the two needed i/o lights! learning a lot about basic and intermediate soldering best practice! Jewels are hard to solder but attainable after a practice session. in the middle of reloactaing what has become a small electronics laboratory to a permanent dog free space, i figured id give you this rather than a Donna-ism (havent heard back yet from management haha!)
